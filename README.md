# Arcanium

I am Arcanium, the Mad Mage of Avalon.

MISSON STATEMENT: To create a bot that is fully capable of playing Avalon.
PURPOSE STATEMENT: To learn more about coding and hopefully bring CCC life to the game.

The goal of this code is to play avalon without any human input of code beyond accessing help files 
to better build scripts and to communicate with others.

The character itself will be of the Mage Profession, one in which I'm already extremely familiar 
with its capabilities.  Skill progression will be flat across the entire skill spectrum.  All skills
being leveled at the same rate.  Learning will only be accomplished once all skills have been
input into the bot, along with enough lessons to gain the next full skill rank.  As such, it will 
quite some time before the bot will be ready to actually learn.

A bronze subscription may need to be purchased.

The tools being utilized for this project are:
G-mail: for character registration and communication.
GitHub: for storage of code versions.
Mudlet: is the client that this will be coded into.
Notepad++: will be used to write the code before being uploaded into Mudlet and GitHub.
Firefox: will be used to review logs which will be in XML.

At it's incarnation, the bot will be permitted to run for 2 hours a day.  With log files being
reviewed the next day and code changes made.  A running updates file will contain all of the changes
made during that review session.

Utilization of the random command in the code will bringing the character to life.  By using random 
at 100 percent, probablilities can be built to define what will be done next.

Sendin raw commands to the mud will be minimized, and the use of aliases and triggers will be 
heavily used.  Ideally the triggers will call aliases.

A split screen approach will be taken with Mudlet.  On the left, 100 Columns displaying the raw text
from the Multi-User Dungeon. On the right side of the screen, metrics and statuses will be displyed 
for live troubleshooting.  A timer will echo the current status of the character, for logging
review purposes.

A secondary purpose of this project is to write a story about the life of Arcanium, as it develops
through the bots travels through the land.  These can be updated into the game's Bulletin Board as
the character progresses through the game.
